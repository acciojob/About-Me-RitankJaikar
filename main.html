            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>
				I enjoy building efficient and user-friendly websites that solve real-world problems. My expertise includes modern frontend technologies such as React, Redux, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, and backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I've also worked extensively with platforms like Webflow and tools like Appsmith to create seamless web solutions.
				<br>As a passionate self-learner, I continuously seek opportunities to enhance my skills. Currently, I’m focused on mastering React and its ecosystem, including state management with Context API and Redux Toolkit. I’ve successfully applied these skills in projects such as a weather app, todo list, and currency converter, integrating APIs, custom hooks, and ensuring responsive, modern designs.
				<br>While I began my programming journey with C and C++, including a solid understanding of foundational Data Structures & Algorithms (such as arrays, strings, objects, maps, pointers..), my focus has since shifted entirely to JavaScript and web development. Over the past year, I’ve been leveraging my skills in JavaScript and JS frameworks and libraries, especially React, to build dynamic, responsive web applications.
				<br>I am seeking a challenging role in Web Development where I can leverage my skills, grow through new experiences, and contribute meaningfully to impactful projects. I believe in constant learning, and what I may lack in experience, I make up with dedication and a determination to improve.
